Histogram:

It does not take a file argument on the command line for input. [-1]


Scramble:

Your scamble program does take command line input [-0].


I am taking one point for checking argv like that, and the SAME
ONE POINT for wasting CPU cycles choosing a random number (neither
is a big deal by itself, in my opinion, even though argv[1] == NULL
has serious potential). [-1]
