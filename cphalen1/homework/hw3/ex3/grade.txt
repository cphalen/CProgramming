1. Memory access issues in the comments.txt both #3 and #4.
[-1]

2. Does not properly skip special characters (comment #4); it resets the index, apparently corrupting the input (try "a.a", for example).
[-1]

3. Palindrome detection works partially, but behaves very badly in a lot of circumstances (issues grown out of the faulty program logic). Your algorithm is good.
[-1]

4. Your program does not terminate when only punctuation is sent to it. Quoting the assignment:
"a line consisting only out of non-alphanumeric characters (such as ‘,’ or spaces), followed by return, should also terminate the program."
[-1]

5. You modified palindrome.h (you removed the last line from it). I am ignoring this...
[-0]

6. Makefile builds a program name that is not correct.
[-1]
