1. multiply has memory access violations (TODO)

2. You didn't test nor implement arb_compare.

3. Your README should describe how certain things were implemented (_add, _multiple, etc), and the members of the struct.

4. Your arb_int is corrupted, if I make one like this:

    arb_int_t fresh
    char s[10];
    arb_from_string(&fresh, "");
    arb_to_string(fresh, s);

5. For arb_from_int, what if source = 0

   int sourceLen = floor(log10(llabs(source))) + 1;
   sourceLen is corrupted! log10(0) is undefined and probably returns garbage. So, it is impossible to make a zero arb_int using your program this way.


6. arb_add doesn't add two negative numbers. It subtracts them instead.


7. arb_multiply has a problem reading and writing past the memory of the arb_int when the left argument is much much larger or smaller than the right.
