Your code is great. Your explanation for number 8 is great, thanks.


Do not use EXIT_SUCCESS nor EXIT_FAILURE for anything other than exit()
and return() from main().

If you still want symbolic constants, define them yourself:
#define OK 0
#define ERR 1

If you never care about the return of these functions (often unwise),
declare them a void rather than int.
